&name; enables PHP scripters to quickly create forms used to interact with data
stored in a MySQL database table. The procedure described below will enable you
to generate the <firstterm>calling script</firstterm> containing the database
logon and a variety of options. An included file
<filename>phpMyEdit.class.php</filename> will later manipulate MySQL records
based on user options which are configurable in the calling script. The calling
script essentially generates one form which facilitates actions that include add
record, change record, copy record, view record, delete record, etc.

&name; is available for download from <ulink
url="http://platon.sk/projects/phpMyEdit/">Platon.SK</ulink>. Extract, or
unzip, the program files to your computer's hard disk. The download file
includes icons and various language files which should be extracted into
sub-folders below the file named <filename>phpMyEdit.class.php</filename>.

Before uploading the program files to your server, make certain that your FTP
client is not configured to force filenames to lower case letters.

With the program files uploaded to your server, point your web browser to the
file named <filename>phpMyEditSetup.php</filename>. You will be prompted to
enter your MySQL database logon (hostname, username, and password) and click the
<GUIbutton>Submit</GUIbutton> button. The logon screen should resemble the picture below.

After successfully logging on to a MySQL database, a list of MySQL tables will
be displayed. Select a table and click the <GUIbutton>Submit</GUIbutton> button.

After selecting a table, a list of its MySQL columns will be displayed. Select a
column that is a unique numeric identifier. The unique numeric identifier is
typically that column which is the unique auto-incremented record ID. Although
non-numeric unique identifiers are also supported, we recommend you to use
numeric one.

</para>
<para>

Below the list of column names you will find two input boxes containing a
suggested <GUIlabel>Page Title</GUIlabel> and suggested <GUIlabel>Base
Filename</GUIlabel>. Either accept or change the content of the input boxes. An
attempt will be made to generate a script, write the script to the base
filename, and then display the script in the web browser.

After clicking the <GUIbutton>Submit</GUIbutton> button, the script should
appear in your web browser along with a message indicating whether or not the
attempted disk write was successful. 

</para>
<para>

Depending on your system configuration, the script may or may not have been
written to the directory from which <filename>phpMyEditSetup.php</filename> was
run. You will need to either open the file that was written to disk or else
highlight and copy the script from the web browser and paste it into a blank
document in your text editor.

<para>

If the proposed <GUIlabel>Base Filename</GUIlabel> was "employees" and the disk
write was successful, a file named <filename>employees.php</filename> would
exist in the directory from which <filename>phpMyEditSetup.php</filename> was
run. 

</para>
<para>

If the disk write was NOT successful and you've pasted the script into your text
editor, save the file in the same directory which contains the phpMyEdit program
files. Save the file with the <filename>.php</filename> extension.

Because HTML header and footer requirements vary between users, no header or
footer is generated. Add or include appropriate HTML markup as necessary (e.g.
&lt;HTML&gt;&lt;HEAD&gt; [headers] &lt;/HEAD&gt;&lt;BODY&gt; [script]
&lt;/BODY&gt;&lt;/HTML&gt;). By default the table will be enclosed by &lt;div
class="main"&gt; ... &lt;/div&gt; which offers a degree of formatting in terms
of using CSS (cascading style sheets). 

</para>
<para>

Once the header and footer are in place, there are script configuration options
that you should review and possibly change.
