Read this carefully:

Because there is chapter "Configuration" and sections (1) "General options" and
"Fields options", all particular general/fields options are in subsections (2).
But it means, that all general options are on one page and all fields options
are on another one page.

In future, if options descriptions grows and you will want to have one HTML page
for every option, you must remove "Configuration" chapter and create "General
configuration" and "Fields configuration" chapters with particular option
sections. These sections will be level 1, so one level higher that is it now.
Every option will have its own HTML page.
