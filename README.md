How many times have you hand coded a MySQL table editor in PHP? 
phpMyEdit application provides an instant table editor.

phpMyEdit generates PHP code for displaying/editing MySQL tables in HTML. All you need to do is to write a simple calling program (a utility to do this is included). It includes a huge set of table manipulation functions (record addition, change, view, copy, and removal), table sorting, filtering, table lookups, and more.

This is taken from the phpmyedit.org site, and upgraded to handle php 7 calls.

phpmyedit seems like it's not being touched anymore, so this is my attempt at keeping it current.
